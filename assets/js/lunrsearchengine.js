    "body": "title: “About - TheMadBlogger. com”— Who is The Mad Blogger?: Welcome to TheMadBlogger. com, the brainchild of a man who’s had his fair share of frustrating encounters with businesses. It all started in South County, St. Louis, at a car dealership that would change the course of his life. The service was so abysmal that it ignited a spark within him, compelling him to register a domain name and pen his very first blog post detailing the poor service he received. But that was just the beginning. The Journey Begins: As he navigated through various industries and interacted with different businesses, he found that his experience in St. Louis wasn’t unique. Disappointments and frustrations seemed to follow him. This realization led to an outpour of blog posts, each one a candid account of his experiences - the good, the bad, and the ugly. TheMadBlogger. com became his platform to voice his opinions, experiences, and, at times, his ire towards businesses that fell short of their promises. Not All Gloom: It’s not all negative, though. When a business does something right, The Mad Blogger is just as passionate about giving credit where it’s due. These shining moments of excellent service and products are also featured on the blog, offering a balanced view of the consumer world. A Voice for Many: TheMadBlogger. com has grown beyond just one man’s voice. It’s now a community where others share their experiences, both frustrating and pleasing. It’s a place for honest reviews, raw emotions, and a true-to-life depiction of consumer experiences. Join the Community: We invite you to explore TheMadBlogger. com. Whether you’ve had a bad day at a store, an incredible dining experience, or just want to see what others are saying - this is the place for you. Join the conversation and be a part of a community that values honesty and real experiences. Thank you for visiting TheMadBlogger. com – where every story is a journey, and every review is a chapter in the larger narrative of consumer experience. "

    "body": "2023/10/24 - Check out the type of folks that work at Roofing and Exterior Pros  Yesterday, Sunday, at ~8:30 AM at 10th &amp; Clark, we witnessed a guy beat the s&amp;@$ out of a guy in a road rage incident. The victim made the mistake of honking at him for running a red light. He then made the mistake of leaving his door unlocked. The assailant was in his work truck — Roofing and Exterior Pros. 314-791-1622. He dragged the victim from his car, beat him to the ground, including kicking him in his face. The victim will need stitches. We called 911. For some reason no police report exists at this time. But hey, crime is down. The assailant then followed a Range Rover that also honked at him during the incident. The assailant began to shoot a gun at the Range Rover during a car chase in Downtown. See attached photos. and of course from an online review:  This morning in downtown St. Louis, I watched the driver of a Roofing &amp; Exterior Pros truck leave his vehicle to assault a driver who made the mistake of honking at him. The passenger of the Roofing &amp; Exterior Pros truck also left the vehicle apparently to provide the driver with backup. The victim suffered numerous severe injuries to his face as the Roofing &amp; Exterior Pros driver punched and kicked him repeatedly. I’ve posted photos of the assault. The SLMPD has better video of the event, but I am not allowed to post them. The driver than exchanged words with a driver of another vehicle and then started to chase the vehicle through the streets of downtown. Per SLMPD, the driver of the Roofing &amp; Exterior Pros truck shot numerous times at the vehicle being chased. I reluctantly write this but feel it’s important that the public is aware of this company’s behavior. Really curious if one of the gentleman in the photo are the owner Jake Ehlinger (John Jacob Ehlinger has a lot of Missouri Case Net files) the “owner” though his wife is on record with the state as the owner, or if they’re just employees. Either way, not a good look for the company. If you’re looking for a roofing company in St. Louis County be sure to look for anyone but Roofing and Exterior Pros! Probably won’t find them online anyways, looks like their Facebook page, Google Listing and other social media profiles are all gone! Update January 2024: Looks like they have tried to “clean up” their online profiles. The TrustReview account appears to have been purged. Their Facebook page is live again, no reviews or negative comments. "

Along the passenger side pulls a pickup truck (a baby one at that) at a stop light. We’re in a school zone, school is in session, the lights are flashing. Speed limit 30 MPH in the school zone. The driver of the Pro-Tec Pest Management pickup truck takes off from the light, accelerating to at least 45-50 MPH in order to pass The Mad Blogger, in the 1/8th of a mile between lights. Photo taken after they passed and then had to wait for another signal. Good job asshole, TMB hopes your company docks your pay or fires you.

After spending far too many hours responding to right wing nut jobs about CRT and the threat of CRT to Rockwood School District (hint, there is no threat). TMB has decided, decreed as it may be, that Talking Heads are the problem. You should read the news. From multiple sources. You should use the things you learned in school (or should have learned in school, which is another problem that is splitting America today), to determine what is factual, and what is simply fake. A person who is paid to have a talk show, be it radio, TV, or online, is paid to get you to listen. They are paid to get you riled up and listening more and more. The way they commonly do that is to spew bullshit out of their mouth. Critical Race Theory is not invading the public school system. Far from it. History, truth, is invading our school system. Teaching our kids about how the world IS and how it CAME TO BE. That’s how they learn. Stop listening to the talking heads. Seriously, sports talk, talk radio, whatever, it is all a waste of time. They are saying what they need to say to get viewers/listeners and generate advertising revenue. Go outside. Take a hike. Ride you bike. Mow your lawn. Do something productive, don’t listen to the talking heads.  The Mad Blogger (Talking Head) signing off for the night. "

    "body": "2022/03/10 - Alright, here is one to get TMB all worked up. The Mad Blogger should have learned his lesson a few months back when trying to cook a tri-tip on the ole BBQ out back, but he didn’t, so history repeated itself on December 25, 2011. The Good Cook Classic Meat Thermometer NSF Approved, pictured, has to be one of the worst designed products of all time. Take a look at that photo. That photo is taken at room temperature. So you start cooking your bird, and you follow the directions, a 20-24 lb bird will likely take between 4. 5 and 5 hours, at least according to the packaging on our turkey. At about 3. 5 hours TMB decides that it is time to check the temperature on the bird, the instructions say the internal temperature of the turkey should be at least 165 degrees to ensure it is fully cooked. Grab your trusty meat thermometer, and stick is in the bird, watch the needle spin. Wait, which needle are we wathing for? Exactly. There is a red needle, and a black needle, but how are you supposed to know which needle is for the temperature, and which is for the “doneness”. There are no instructions, there is nothing written on the display to give you a hint. The only way to read this is (based on my testing, against another thermometer) the BLACK needle measures the temperature, so you need to stick it in the bird you are measuring and wait for it to spin around the dial. Wherever the black needle stops is the current (or close to) temperature. The Mad Blogger googled some results, but found posts stating both the Black and the Red needle are used for the temperature, so obviously there is a ton of confusion out there. The “GoodCook” website doesn’t even show you a details page for this thermometer anymore, you have to go and find it in a Cached version from google, I can only imagine this is because they don’t have any faith in it. This product has to have the worst User Experience and ease of use of any product I have ever purchased. DO NOT BUY "

If you purchase tickets for a movie online, you will be charged a service fee. If that movie is for some reason cancelled, they will:  Not inform you ahead of time.  Not refund you the full price you paid for the tickets and the service fee. Good luck getting B&amp;B Theaters to respond to you either. While they might actually respond to a “review” posted on Google Maps ratings, they won’t go any further than that. Please check out one of these theaters close to Wildwood:: [AMC Chesterfield 14 located in the Chesterfield Mall (CLOSED)] Marcus Theaters in Chesterfield, Missouri Whenever you walk into the B&amp;B Theaters in Wildwood, Missouri you are just about guaranteed to walk into a smokey (burnt popcorn) room with very poor customer service being provided. Please avoid the B&amp;B Theaters in Wildwood, they will just steal your money. Theft from B&amp;B Theaters in Wildwood, Missouri: We finally got someone to respond to us on Twitter after reaching out to B&amp;B Theaters, and they replied that they will not refund the transaction fees. So ultimately the theater sold tickets to provide a service, cancelled the showing of the movie, and then will not refund the full amount charged. "

A month ago TMB moved, and because of that decided that it was time to get a new TV for the bedroom, rather than moving the old CRT across the country. So TMB picked up a Samsung 40’ LCD TV that did 1080p and 120mhz, the model was LN40C630K1F and it was purchased from Best Buy. All seemed well at first, the TV performed great, until TMB noticed something, a blue pixel on the screen, when it shouldn’t be blue. So after about a week (of the bad pixel) the TV went back to Best Buy to get exchanged for another of the same model. I brought this new TV home and hooked it up, everything was great for a few minutes then the TV was attacked by some red vertical lines, which eventually turned to black. TMB checked connections, restarted everything, with no change. Eventually the lines went away, but they came back a few times throughout the week. Today TMB took the TV back to Best Buy and picked up a 40’ Sony LCD. Thanks to Best Buy for the great customer service! They were extremely helpful throughout the whole process. TMB went ahead and purchased their 4yr protection plan for the new TV, just in case anything goes wrong with this one. "

Well two weeks ago they started carrying ABC in HD. Yet, TMB hasn't recieved it at all, and actually hasn't received TNTHD which Charter has been airing for 4 months.  TMB called charter today to figure out why both of these channels don't work and the stupid f'n Charter Customer Service rep said  we're having problem with the HD providers  and can't do anything about it. When The Mad Blogger asked if he could get a credit for the service not working, she asked  on one channel? . That's when TMB lost it. The Mad Blogger has never used foul language towards a customer service rep before, but today TMB went nuts and told her that their  Service f'n sucks  and then promptly hung up. The Mad Blogger will be getting Directv scheduled to come out and install over the next week or two. Charter Sucks, Charter customer service sucks, TMB highly recommends NOT using Charter for cable TV service. "

It's not necessary to contact Customer Service or Technical Support. Instead, please try to file your return again later. The best time to file electronically is usually between 4:00 a. m. and 4:00 p. m. Pacific time. We apologize for the inconvenience.   Not necessary to contact customer service? What kind of a message is that, TMB MUST call now.  Well it looks like TMB got a bit lucky and his Tax Returns were finally filed (so far in pending status). Now we'll wait and see what shows up. Hopefully tomorrow TMB will be able to see them submitted. Suprisingly TMB did get through to customer service this evening with an 888 number. The Mad Blogger was on hold for less than 2 minutes, boy TMB sure wishes Charter Communications Customer Service was that prompt. When the guy picked up my return actually went through, so TMB asked him what the deal was. He went into a lecture on how the IRS was having server problems this morning, and that backed intuit up, this afternoon it got better, and then this evening it got worse again. After the IRS had problems, then every tax service, Jackson Hewitt (he mentioned them directly) and anyone else doing e-filing, so that'll slow things down. After that he brought up that the IRS usually has a major computer problem once a year, but it's usually in January or February, not tax day' 5 minutes later The Mad Blogger finally got him to stop talking and told him that TMB's return went through. Based on Intuit's customer service response on the phone tonight (at midnight CST) TMB will be using Turbo Tax again next year, TMB just won't wait till the last minute to submit! "

They didn't have anyone sing the National Anthem? Hello, Red Sox, Major League Baseball? Anyone listening? Who's idea was it to leave out the National Anthem? Every game TMB has ever gone to has had the National Anthem sung prior to the game, why was today different? This is a huge disgrace and disservice for the Men and Women who have and continue to fight for the freedom that allows us to bask in a day like opening day at Fenway Park. I hope that the Red Sox organization takes action and sees that the National Anthem is performed at all of the rest of the games held under MLB rules for the rest of 2007, and the rest of time, as it should be.

This NEMOFANG (recently changed his ID to (valorxnemo), also known as Hsing-Yao Fang is an engineering student at Ohio State University and he uses fraudulant methods when shopping on Ebay. Here's TMB's story. TMB was selling a 2003 Nissan 350Z on Ebay and Nemofang bid the starting bid price of $14500. Nemofang contacted TMB about the purchase, and even said he'd fly out to pick the car up, bringing CASH for the auction or a bank check. Less than 24 hours before auction was to end another bidder stepped up to the plate and bid $14,600, $100 more than Nemofang's bid. This bidder was a729241025 who happened to have -1 for feedback on EBay's feedback system. TMB doesn't let anyone with negative feedback bid on his auctions so the bid was cancelled. Fast forward to the end of the auction, Nemofang is the only bidder so he wins the auction at $14,500. TMB emails Nemofang (Hsing-Yao Fang) reminding him that a $500 deposit is due via Paypal within 24 hours of the auction's close. Hsing-Yao Fang emails TMB back and says that he only has $11k cash and can't afford the auction, and he's sorry for letting TMB know so late. This starts to infuriate TMB, but what infuriates The Mad Blogger even more is that when he starts to reply to Nemofang's email he notices the email address is mailto:a729241025@hotmail. com) If that looks familiar to you that's because it is the exact same userId as the second bidder who had negative feedback. So, being a semi bright guy The Mad Blogger has now put ttwo and two together. For those of you who may not see what TMB means, let TMB break is down for you. Nemofang bid on a car, TMB's Nissan 350z, and then decided he either didn't want to buy it, or couldn't afford it, so he used another account that he has setup with Ebay to outbid his initial bid. This other account is setup with purpose of winning auctions but never paying for the items, you can check out the history of the account to see exactly that, he's used it twice in the past to win an auction but never paid for either item. So now here is The Mad Blogger's mission. TMB will most likely be taking Nemofang, also known by his real name of Hsing-Yao Fang, to small claims court to retrieve financial damages caused by Hsing-Yao Fang's fraudulant practices. TMB will also be reporting Hsing-Yao Fang to Ohio State for using their computers for fraudulant interstate commerce activities. The Mad Blogger will also be making sure that if anyone ever searches for Nemofang or Hsing-Yao Fang, they will know not to trust this user, and hopefully not to ever employee this person. Here's a little information TMB was able to locate on the web about Nemofang aka Hsing-Yao Fang His address is 364 West Lane AveColumbus, OH 43201United States Here's his Ohio State Information FANG, HSING-YAO Unique name at OSU = fang. 67Email addresses:  Published address = fang. 67@osu. edu Major:  ENGINEERING-UNDECLARED College:  ENGINEERING If anyone else has any information on valorxnemo/Nemofang/Hsing-Yao Fang please let TMB know.

So, if you install AIM, be sure to go to control panel/add remove programs, and remove all instances of Viewpoint from your computer. Plain and simple, Viewpoint is spyware.  TMB recommends using Windows Live Onecare for all yoru Virus,spyware and firewall needs. It's only $50 to cover 3 computers with the software, TMB uses it and it works great!

The only redeeming value of the whole VMA show was the OK GO dance routine they performed on treadmills. Here are a few other comments from The Mad Blogger.

Granted, because the tip was on a credit card she'd probably have to report it on taxes anyways, but I'd bet the tipper wasn't exactly looking for a lot of National press out of it. She also mentioned buying a Jeep with it, I hope it's a used jeep, because that tip once the taxes are taken won't buy any new car! TMB worked in a restaurant for a few years in college, and always reported his tips, but I'm sure many people in the industry make hundreds of dollars a night without reporting 5% of that money to the IRS.

TMB and Family went there for dinner. It was STILL HORRIBLE. The food is just very low quality, high prices and the chips both times tasted burnt. So, if you are looking for a restaurant on Manchester road for some good Mexican, TMB suggests trying one of the other places on Manchester Road. Senor Pique’s (sp?) down near Sulpher Springs Road is a good start, TMB’s eaten there on many occasions and it’s been great food and service. Don’t eat at Zapata’s, trust The Mad Blogger! "

    "body": "2006/08/27 - So some of you have read how The Mad Blogger's Friday started out. In summary, it started out horrible all due to Southtown Dodge. This story however, is about how TMB's Friday ended up, and we must say, it ended up FAR better than it started out! After the whole fiasco with Southtown TMB decided he'd drive around to a few other car dealers on Friday evening. Prior to heading out he spent a couple hours searching on the new for a Tahoe Z71 in the St. Louis area.  TMB didn't have much luck with the web searching, there didn't appear to be too many Z71s in the St. Louis area that were low mileage and not in the maroon color. Not to be drug down by the lack of results TMB decided he'd try it the old fasioned way and visit some of the local dealers. First on the map was Elco Chevrolet, a division of the Enterprise Leasing Company, down on Manchester road. The Mad Blogger spent nearly 3 hours at Elco Chevrolet talking to a nice salesman named Eric. Eric was possibly the most knowledgable salesperson that TMB has ever dealt with, that definitely helped keep him in their grasp. They had a 2005 Tahoe Z71, white (TMB's preferred color), but it had a few things that were of concern. It was an 05, but had 34k miles on it, TMB was looking for something that was still going to be covered by a factory warranty for some time. Also of concern was that the vehicle smelled like smoke (TMB doesn't smoke, be patient, TMB will be sure to rant about smokers in a future post), and the condition of the paint. The vehicle had quite a few rock chips as well as a few dings and scrapes here and there. TMB can be kind of anal, so these things sat big on TMB's mind and luckily delayed him from purchasing the vehicle Friday evening. After a few hours of talking with Eric at Elco TMB made his way further west on Manchester and as he drove by Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury noticed a dark colored Z71 sitting in the used lot with a pricetag of $29900. TMB swung his car around and quickly made his way over to this used Tahoe. It was immaculate, and TMB about fell over when he saw the mileage on the car. 7600 miles, could that be right? Was that just a trip meter or the odometer? After a few double takes TMB was out on a test drive with his salesman Kevin. Kevin was straight up honest, they had just taken the car in on trade a couple days ago and it hadn't been cleaned up, though it honestly didn't need it. After a quick test drive TMB started on the paperwork. Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury had no problems with the pre-approval check, they even called up the bank to confirm everything with them. Dave Sinclair LM also offered TMB a second set of wheels for the Tahoe. They had a digital picture but had some problems printing it out, TMB ended up buying this second set of wheels for an additional $600, though he's not yet taken possession of this additional set of tires, he'll be picking them up Monday August 28th! After about 2 hours total at Dave Sinclair TMB drove off in his 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe, which at the time had 76** miles on it, though as of this post has over 7800 miles on it now! The Mad Blogger would love to thank Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury for salvaging his Friday night and providing such a great vehicle! "

    "title": "Why not to buy from Southtown Dodge, AKA Southtown Dodge Sucks",
    "body": "2006/08/25 - Well lets begin the story with a little background. The Mad Blogger was in the mood for a new ride. He’s been driving a 2003 Nissan 350Z for 3+ years now, and wanted something up off the ground, a bit more visible and much larger. So he began by searching for used Chevrolet Tahoes. Why a Tahoe? Why not, The Mad Blogger can afford gas, even as prices rise, so why bother with trying to be “green”, The Mad Blogger is not PC. It didn’t take TMB (The Mad Blogger) long to find what he was looking for. A 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71, 4x4, every option on it except for a third row seat, and navigation. The Mad Blogger has no kids, he needs not a third row seat, he’s also a man, he can find his way out of a pitchdark room with no doors, navigation is not a necessity. He found his new ride at Southtown Dodge on Lindbergh Blvd in south St. Louis County. Now it was time to deal. The Tahoe had been sitting on the lot for over 90 days when TMB found it, so this meant he should be able to get a good deal. Priced out on KBB. com TMB found it to have a value of roughly $34k, asking price on it was $26,903. First offer to the dealer, Southtown Dodge, salesman was Mike Wall, was 25,500. The dealer wouldn’t budge, they said they were at their clearance price and wouldn’t come down. $26903, plus a BS fee of $97 dollars for paperwork. The Mad Blogger would have none of this, he came back with another offer of $26,500 a day later, the dealer still wouldn’t budge. They did know what the truck was worth, and weren’t going to move on it. Fine, The Mad Blogger knows when to jump on a good deal. So he calls the dealer up this morning to tell them he’ll be there at 4:30pm to give them his pre-approved loan information, and pick up the vehicle. Good ole Mike Wall comes back and says, sorry, we can’t clean it up for delivery till we have a deposit or have started on the paperwork. So The Mad Blogger agrees to go down there over his lunch break and get the paperwork started. TMB doesn’t really care if they clean the Tahoe, it’s going to rain today, all he wanted was them to put the Brush Bar back on the front which they had removed between the first time TMB looked at it and the second time he went back. TMB arrives at the dealer shortly after 11:30am this morning, good ole Mike Wall is there with the paperwork already started. Mike looks over The Mad Blogger’s preapproved loan information and tells him that he won’t be able to turn the Tahoe over to TMB for 7-10 days. WTF? Excuse The Mad Blogger, did you just tell him he can’t pickup this truck today? TMB comes in with a loan check that he’s been told is as good as cash and Southtown Dodge won’t let him take the vehicle for 7-10 days? TMB don’t think so. After 15-20 minutes of no progress The Mad Blogger decides it’s time to leave. The first thing TMB does it call up his lender to verify that the check should be good as gold with a dealer. They confirm this and say that they don’t have problems with dealers accepting their checks, they did offer to talk to the dealer and have them a check mailed next day to arrive on Saturday. TMB declines, he’s done dealing with Southtown Dodge. TMB decides he’ll check for himself and jumps off the highway to stop at another dealer, Sunset Ford. The sales guy at Sunset Ford (sorry TMB didn’t get his name to give him props) said they would have no problem accepting the TMB preapproved loan check and selling him a vehicle on the spot. Unfortunately for The Mad Blogger they didn’t have a used Tahoe on the lot. So, what’s the moral of The Mad Blogger’s story? Don’t let a dealer like Southtown Dodge jack you around. If the sales guy, Mike Wall, or whomever your sales person is, EVER acts like a *** to you, walk out of there. The Mad Blogger took a little crap from Mike hoping he’d still get a good deal on this truck. He got nothing but a weeks worth of wasted time when he could have found another vehicle. Southtown Dodge Sucks! "
