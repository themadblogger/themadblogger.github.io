"Why not to buy from Southtown Dodge, AKA Southtown Dodge Sucks",Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks,"<p>Well lets begin the story with a little background.</p>

<p>The Mad Blogger was in the mood for a new ride. He&#39;s been driving a 2003 Nissan 350Z for 3+ years now, and wanted something up off the ground, a bit more visible and much larger. So he began by searching for used Chevrolet Tahoes. Why a Tahoe? Why not, The Mad Blogger can afford gas, even as prices rise, so why bother with trying to be &quot;green&quot;, The Mad Blogger is not PC.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t take TMB (The Mad Blogger) long to find what he was looking for. A 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe Z71, 4x4, every option on it except for a third row seat, and navigation. The Mad Blogger has no kids, he needs not a third row seat, he&#39;s also a man, he can find his way out of a pitchdark room with no doors, navigation is not a necessity.</p>

<p>He found his new ride at Southtown Dodge on Lindbergh Blvd in south St. Louis County. Now it was time to deal. The Tahoe had been sitting on the lot for over 90 days when TMB found it, so this meant he should be able to get a good deal. Priced out on KBB.com TMB found it to have a value of roughly $34k, asking price on it was $26,903. First offer to the dealer, Southtown Dodge, salesman was Mike Wall, was 25,500. The dealer wouldn&#39;t budge, they said they were at their clearance price and wouldn&#39;t come down. $26903, plus a BS fee of $97 dollars for paperwork.</p>

<p>The Mad Blogger would have none of this, he came back with another offer of $26,500 a day later, the dealer still wouldn&#39;t budge. They did know what the truck was worth, and weren&#39;t going to move on it. Fine, The Mad Blogger knows when to jump on a good deal. So he calls the dealer up this morning to tell them he&#39;ll be there at 4:30pm to give them his pre-approved loan information, and pick up the vehicle. Good ole Mike Wall comes back and says, sorry, we can&#39;t clean it up for delivery till we have a deposit or have started on the paperwork. So The Mad Blogger agrees to go down there over his lunch break and get the paperwork started. TMB doesn&#39;t really care if they clean the Tahoe, it&#39;s going to rain today, all he wanted was them to put the Brush Bar back on the front which they had removed between the first time TMB looked at it and the second time he went back.</p>

<p>TMB arrives at the dealer shortly after 11:30am this morning, good ole Mike Wall is there with the paperwork already started. Mike looks over The Mad Blogger&#39;s preapproved loan information and tells him that he won&#39;t be able to turn the Tahoe over to TMB for 7-10 days. WTF? Excuse The Mad Blogger, did you just tell him he can&#39;t pickup this truck today? TMB&nbsp;comes in with a loan check that he&#39;s been told is as good as cash and Southtown Dodge won&#39;t let him take the vehicle for 7-10 days? TMB don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>After 15-20 minutes of no progress The Mad Blogger decides it&#39;s time to leave. The first thing TMB does it call up his lender to verify that the check should be good as gold with a dealer. They confirm this and say that they don&#39;t have problems with dealers accepting their checks, they did offer to talk to the dealer and have them a check mailed next day to arrive on Saturday. TMB declines, he&#39;s done dealing with Southtown Dodge. TMB decides he&#39;ll check for himself and jumps off the highway to stop at another dealer, Sunset Ford. The sales guy at Sunset Ford (sorry&nbsp;TMB didn&#39;t get his name to give him props) said they would have no problem accepting the TMB preapproved loan check and selling him a vehicle on the spot. Unfortunately for The Mad Blogger they didn&#39;t have a used Tahoe on the lot.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s the moral of The Mad Blogger&#39;s story? Don&#39;t let a dealer like Southtown Dodge jack you around. If the sales guy, Mike Wall, or whomever your sales person is, EVER acts like a *** to you, walk out of there. The Mad Blogger took a little crap from Mike hoping he&#39;d still get a good deal on this truck. He got nothing but a weeks worth of wasted time when he could have found another vehicle.</p>

Shop at Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury! The day was saved!,Shop-at-Dave-Sinclair-Lincoln-Mercury-The-day-was-saved,"<p>So The Mad Blogger (TMB) went out shopping for a car this evening, trying to repair <a href=""http://themadblogger.org/blogs/themadblogger/archive/2006/08/25/Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge_2C00_-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks.aspx"">the chaos that was earlier today</a>.</p>

<p>Long story short (it&#39;s too late right now, long story to come tomorrow), TMB is VERY happy this morning(night). TMB has a new ride. An 05 Chevy Tahoe Z71 with less than 8k miles on it! TMB will ALSO be getting some 20&#39;s tomorrow morning for the Tahoe. Photos and the rest of the story to come tomorrow!</p>

"How The Mad Blogger got happy, Thanks to Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury...",How-The-Mad-Blogger-got-happy-Thanks-to-Dave-Sinclair-Lincoln-Mercury,"<p>So some of you have read how <a href=""http://themadblogger.org/blogs/themadblogger/archive/2006/08/25/Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge_2C00_-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks.aspx"">The Mad Blogger&#39;s Friday started out</a>. In summary, it started out horrible all due to <a href=""http://themadblogger.org/blogs/themadblogger/archive/2006/08/25/Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge_2C00_-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks.aspx"">Southtown Dodge</a>. This story however, is about how TMB&#39;s Friday ended up, and we must say, it ended up FAR better than it started out! After the whole fiasco with <a href=""http://themadblogger.org/blogs/themadblogger/archive/2006/08/25/Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge_2C00_-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks.aspx"">Southtown</a> TMB decided he&#39;d drive around to a few other car dealers on Friday evening. Prior to heading out he spent a couple hours searching on the new for a Tahoe Z71 in the St. Louis area. </p>

<p>TMB didn&#39;t have much luck with the web searching, there didn&#39;t appear to be too many Z71s in the St. Louis area that were low mileage and not in the maroon color. Not to be drug down by the lack of results TMB decided he&#39;d try it the old fasioned way and visit some of the local dealers. First on the map was Elco Chevrolet, a division of the Enterprise Leasing Company, down on Manchester road. The Mad Blogger spent nearly 3 hours at Elco Chevrolet talking to a nice salesman named Eric. Eric was possibly the most knowledgable salesperson that TMB has ever dealt with, that definitely helped keep him in their grasp. They had a 2005 Tahoe Z71, white (TMB&#39;s preferred color), but it had a few things that were of concern. It was an 05, but had 34k miles on it, TMB was looking for something that was still going to be covered by a factory warranty for some time. Also of concern was that the vehicle smelled like smoke (TMB doesn&#39;t smoke, be patient, TMB will be sure to rant about smokers in a future post), and the condition of the paint. The vehicle had quite a few rock chips as well as a few dings and scrapes here and there.</p>

<p>TMB can be kind of anal, so these things sat big on TMB&#39;s mind and luckily delayed him from purchasing the vehicle Friday evening. After a few hours of talking with Eric at Elco TMB made his way further west on Manchester and as he drove by Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury noticed a dark colored Z71 sitting in the used lot with a pricetag of $29900. TMB swung his car around and quickly made his way over to this used Tahoe. It was immaculate, and TMB about fell over when he saw the mileage on the car. 7600 miles, could that be right? Was that just a trip meter or the odometer?</p>

<p>After a few double takes TMB was out on a test drive with his salesman Kevin. Kevin was straight up honest, they had just taken the car in on trade a couple days ago and it hadn&#39;t been cleaned up, though it honestly didn&#39;t need it. After a quick test drive TMB started on the paperwork. Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury&nbsp;had no problems with the&nbsp;pre-approval check, they even called up the bank to&nbsp;confirm everything with them.</p>

<p>Dave Sinclair LM also offered TMB a second set of wheels for the Tahoe. They had a digital picture but had some problems printing it out, TMB ended up buying this second set of wheels for an additional $600, though he&#39;s not yet taken possession of this additional set of tires, he&#39;ll be picking them up Monday August 28th!</p>

<p>After about 2 hours total at Dave Sinclair TMB drove off in his 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe, which at the time had 76** miles on it, though as of this post has over 7800 miles on it now! The Mad Blogger would love to thank Dave Sinclair Lincoln Mercury for salvaging his Friday night and providing such a great vehicle!</p>",2006-08-27,html
Zapatas Mexican Restaurant on Manchester Road in Missouri,Zapatas-Mexican-Restaurant-on-Manchester-Road-in-Missouri,"<p><a href=""http://chrishammond.com/blogs/archive/2006/05/10/Zapatas_on_Manchester_Sucks.aspx"">Originally posted here...</a></p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for some good Mexican food, DON&#39;T go to Zapatas on Manchester Road!</p>

<p>The Mad Blogger&nbsp;went&nbsp;w/ the office the day they opened, for lunch, to give them a shot. The food was horrible, no one enjoyed their meals. TMB figured, maybe, just maybe, that was just a bad day to go, the first day a place is open.</p>

<p>So, a month later,&nbsp;TMB tried it again. TMB and Family went there for dinner. It was STILL HORRIBLE. The food is just very low quality, high prices and&nbsp;the chips both times tasted burnt.</p>

<p>So, if you are looking for a restaurant on Manchester road for some good Mexican, TMB suggests trying one of the other places on Manchester Road. Senor Pique&#39;s (sp?) down near Sulpher Springs Road is a good start,&nbsp;TMB&#39;s eaten there on many occasions and it&#39;s been great food and service.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t eat at Zapata&#39;s, trust The Mad Blogger!</p>",2006-08-28,html
"Charter Cable, Internet, Telephone Customer Service Blows",Charter-Cable-Internet-Telephone-Customer-Service-Blows,"<p>If you&#39;re looking to get Digital Cable, Internet or Phone Service from Charter Communications, The Mad Blogger would HIGHLY recommend looking to another provider!</p>

<p>TMB has had horrible experiences with Charter over the past few months. <a href=""http://chrishammond.com/blogs/archive/2006/08/15/Charter-Sucks.aspx"">To read about some of them check out this link.</a>&nbsp;Just so you know TMB isn&#39;t the only one complaining check out this recent article in the <a href=""http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/business/columnists.nsf/techtalk/story/79D69F12C866F53286257194004A5C3E?OpenDocument"">St. Louis Post Dispatch</a>!</p>

MTV VMAs,MTV-VMAs,"<p>So The Mad Blogger sat at home this evening hoping to be highly entertained by the 2006 VMAs on MTV. TMB got to watch the VMAs in HD on MHD, Music HD, an apparent compilation HD channel for MTV VH1 and CMT.</p>

<p>Jack Black was hosting the show and started out his intro, it was terrible. TMB is&nbsp;a huge fan of Jack Black, TMB loves all of his work, but tonight it was flat out horrible. The only redeeming value of the whole VMA show was the OK GO dance routine they performed on treadmills.</p>

<p>Here are a few other comments from The Mad Blogger.</p>

<p>Lil Kim: Who cares, you got out of jail, no one really missed you.</p>

<p>Fifty Cent and LL Cool J: WTF were you guys rambling about? (TMB likes your music, just not your talking)</p>

<p>Kanye West: Sorry dude, 95% of America still hates you, TMB is included in this 95%.</p>

<p>Sarah Silverman: Nothing you said all night was funny, who are you anyways?</p>

<p>Jackass Number 2: TMB can&#39;t wait to see this one!</p>

<p>The Mad Blogger will surely remember more to rant about in the morning. For now,TMB needs some beauty sleep.</p>

"Big tip, big taxes!",Big-tip-big-taxes,"<p>Now hear this, The Mad Blogger is not suggesting anyone try to skip paying taxes to the IRS, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/31/bigtip.ap/index.html"" target=""_blank"">but this girl should never have made a mention about this huge tip, other than to her bosses to verify it was legit.</a></p>

<p>Now she&#39;s going to pay a big ole fat portion of that tip in taxes. Granted, because the tip was on a credit card she&#39;d probably have to report it on taxes anyways, but I&#39;d bet the tipper wasn&#39;t exactly looking for a lot of National press out of it. She also mentioned buying a Jeep with it, I hope it&#39;s a used jeep, because that tip once the taxes are taken won&#39;t buy any new car!</p>

<p>TMB worked in a restaurant for a few years in college, and always reported his tips, but I&#39;m sure many people in the industry make hundreds of dollars a night without reporting 5% of that money to the IRS.</p>",2006-09-01,html

<p>Plain and simple, Viewpoint is spyware. </p>

"Don't hire Hsing-Yao Fang, Hsing-Yao Fang (nemofang, valorxnemo) sucks",Dont-hire-Hsing-Yao-Fang-Hsing-Yao-Fang-(nemofang-valorxnemo)-sucks,"<P>This is a warning to any companies out there, or Ebay listers out there. Don't do business with the ebay user ID NEMOFANG. </P>

<P>This NEMOFANG (recently changed his ID to (<STRONG>valorxnemo)</STRONG>, also known as Hsing-Yao Fang is an engineering student at Ohio State University and he uses fraudulant methods when shopping on Ebay.</P>

<P>Here's TMB's story. TMB was selling a 2003 Nissan 350Z on Ebay and Nemofang bid the starting bid price of $14500. Nemofang contacted TMB about the purchase, and even said he'd fly out to pick the car up, bringing CASH for the auction or a bank check.</P>

<P>Less than 24 hours before auction was to end another bidder stepped up to the plate and bid $14,600, $100 more than Nemofang's bid. This bidder was <A href=""http://myworld.ebay.com/ebaymotors/a729241025"">a729241025</A> who happened to have -1 for feedback on EBay's feedback system. TMB doesn't let anyone with negative feedback bid on his auctions so the bid was cancelled.</P>

<P>Fast forward to the end of the auction, Nemofang is the only bidder so he wins the auction at $14,500. TMB emails Nemofang (Hsing-Yao Fang) reminding him that a $500 deposit is due via Paypal within 24 hours of the auction's close. Hsing-Yao Fang emails TMB back and says that he only has $11k cash and can't afford the auction, and he's sorry for letting TMB know so late.</P>

<P>This starts to infuriate TMB, but what infuriates The Mad Blogger even more is that when he starts to reply to Nemofang's email he notices the email address is <A href=""mailto:a729241025@hotmail.com)"">mailto:a729241025@hotmail.com)</A> If that looks familiar to you that's because it is the exact same userId as the second bidder who had negative feedback.</P>

<P>So, being a semi bright guy The Mad Blogger has now put ttwo and two together. For those of you who may not see what TMB means, let TMB break is down for you. Nemofang bid on a car, TMB's Nissan 350z, and then decided he either didn't want to buy it, or couldn't afford it, so he used another account that he has setup with Ebay to outbid his initial bid. This other account is setup with purpose of winning auctions but never paying for the items, you can check out the history of the account to see exactly that, he's used it twice in the past to win an auction but never paid for either item.</P>

<P>So now here is The Mad Blogger's mission. TMB will most likely be taking Nemofang, also known by his real name of Hsing-Yao Fang, to small claims court to retrieve financial damages caused by Hsing-Yao Fang's fraudulant practices. TMB will also be reporting Hsing-Yao Fang to Ohio State for using their computers for fraudulant interstate commerce activities.</P>

<P>The Mad Blogger will also be making sure that if anyone ever searches for Nemofang or Hsing-Yao Fang, they will know not to trust this user, and hopefully not to ever employee this person. Here's a little information TMB was able to locate on the web about Nemofang aka Hsing-Yao Fang</P>

<P>His address is </P>

<P>364 West Lane Ave<BR>Columbus,&nbsp;OH&nbsp;43201<BR>United States</P>

<P>Here's his Ohio State Information</P>

Are you a Lonelygirl? Follow the Order of the Denderah?,Are-you-a-Lonelygirl-Follow-the-Order-of-the-Denderah,"<p>Back when The Mad Blogger started using YouTube he came across some videos from someone named Lonelygirl15. For some reason TMB had to start watching them, sort of like getting stuck watching Laguna Beach on MTV. They are trainwrecks, teenage lives you just can help but watch and laugh at.</p>

<p>Well, fast forward a few months and you may have now heard of Longelygirl15, she&#39;s been on Leno, and all over the news. It ends up Lonelygirl15 is an actress, I won&#39;t go into the details, if you want to know them google her. Anyways, TMB still watches the Lonelygirl15 videos on Youtube, though they don&#39;t have the same intrigue now that the truth is out and they are all &quot;fake&quot; </p>

Great Service from JPCustoms for car stereo needs!,Great-Service-from-JPCustoms-for-car-stereo-needs,"<P>TheMadBlogger loves his Zune. He loves it so much he wants to listen to it when he's driving in his pimped out Chevrolet Tahoe.</P>

<P>TMB purchased the Zune Car Pack from Circuit City a few days ago, it was horrible. The reception wasn't worth a darn, so TMB took the device back to Circuit City, they refunded the money without question. Props from the TMB to Circuit City.</P>

<P>Since that wouldn't work, TMB started looking for other options and found that <A href=""http://www.jpcustoms.com/"">www.JPCustoms.com</A> had just the attachment he needed to hardwire the Zune into the existing stereo of the Chevy Tahoe. That was two days ago, on Wednesday. The Mad Blogger received a package at work today from JP Customs with the product inside. Props to JPCustoms.com for the prompt service! </P>

Charter Communications is staffed by Idiots,Charter-Communications-is-staffed-by-Idiots,"<P>Wednesday The Mad Blogger&nbsp;got Charter setup at the new house, they transfered the 10 meg internet service, and HD cable over. Internet came up, cable came up. With multiple speedtests throughout the day it was found that the speed was not 10 meg service, it was around 4meg with 256k up. TMB called Charter Wednesday evening, and of course got a fricken phone center in Indonesia somewhere who had a fake American name and couldn't hardly speak english. TMB requested a technician come out and fix the issue, they setup an appointment for 1-5pm Saturday.</P>

<P>Today is Saturday, around 4:40pm TMB has had enough waiting and calls Charter. After 15 minutes on hold The Mad Blogger finally decides to call again, this time on the cell phone. The cellphone call gets answered first, by some chick who sounds like she just came across the border, and can't even locate TMB's account in their system. Lucky for TMB someone else picked up the original phone call, this person was female, and by her accent, or lack there of, obviously someone within the borders of the U S of A.</P>

<P>This lady, who was very darn helpful, notices that TMB said he should have 10meg service, but that the service at the new address is setup for 3meg. 5 minutes later all is well in the world of The Mad Blogger. Charter comes through with an american who can help me, and fails yet again with their foriegn phone support who can't do *** right. Thanks for the help Charter, close down your f'ng overseas call centers. </P>

Well guess what Charter, The Mad Blogger will gladly pay for CBS and ABC in high def, but you don't offer it. Guess what, Directv and Dish offer it, so I guess TMB will be going to one of them shortly.

TMB spent 1.5 hours on the phone with Charter last night trying to get his 10mb internet service, after multiple speed tests The Mad Blogger was only getting 3mb service, which means 256k upload. After 1.5 hours on hold the Charter Tech suggested reseting the Cable modem. TMB said alright, and hoped that would fix the issue. No such luck last night, but TMB was not about to wait on hold anymore. Tonight TMB tries to reset the modem again, leaving it unplugged for 2-3 minutes. </P>

<P>When it's all plugged back in we're still in the same place, 3mb service. After another 20 minutes on hold the Technician picks up and tells The Mad Blogger that if you've already tried reseting it he won't be able to help. TMB asks him to reprovision the modem, and sure enough, TMB runs a speed test and boom, we're at 10mb again.</P>

<P>The Red Sox had Harry Connick Jr. there to sing ""America"" before the game, they even had a flyover with some National Guard F-15s, but after the flyover they just went on with Opening Ceremonies. They didn't have anyone sing the National Anthem?</P>

<P>Hello, Red Sox, Major League Baseball? Anyone listening? Who's idea was it to leave out the National Anthem? Every game TMB has ever gone to has had the National Anthem sung prior to the game, why was today different?

<P>""The Intuit Electronic Filing Center is experiencing unusually heavy demand and is unable to accept returns at this time. It's not necessary to contact Customer Service or Technical Support. Instead, please try to file your return again later. The best time to file electronically is usually between 4:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Pacific time. We apologize for the inconvenience.""</P>

<P>Not necessary to contact customer service? What kind of a message is that, TMB MUST call now. </P>

<P>Well it looks like TMB got a bit lucky and his Tax Returns were finally filed (so far in pending status).</P>

<P>Now we'll wait and see what shows up. Hopefully tomorrow&nbsp;TMB will&nbsp;be able to see them submitted. Suprisingly&nbsp;TMB did get through to customer service this evening with an 888 number.&nbsp;The Mad Blogger&nbsp;was on hold for less than 2 minutes,&nbsp;boy TMB sure wishes Charter Communications Customer Service was that prompt.</P>

<P>When the guy picked up my return actually went through, so&nbsp;TMB asked him what the deal was. He went into a lecture on how the IRS was having server problems this morning, and that backed intuit up, this afternoon it got better, and then this evening it got worse again. After the IRS had problems, then every tax service, Jackson Hewitt (he mentioned them directly) and anyone else doing e-filing, so that'll slow things down. After that he brought up that the IRS usually has a major computer problem once a year, but it's usually in January or February, not tax day'</P>

<P>5 minutes later&nbsp;The Mad&nbsp;Blogger&nbsp;finally got him to stop talking and&nbsp;told him&nbsp;that&nbsp;TMB's return&nbsp;went through.</P>

<P>Based on Intuit's customer service response on the phone tonight (at midnight CST) TMB will be&nbsp;using Turbo Tax again next year,&nbsp;TMB just won't wait till the last minute to submit!</P>",2007-04-18,html

<P>TMB is about ready to take this POS ford and go to a Chevy Dealership and buy a real truck. </P>

When he saw that it didn't he had TMB roll down the window and gave him a quick lecture on how he should have a front and rear plate, as that is the state law.</P>

TMB didn't take the bait, instead he asked if there were any better deals, to which he was immediately shot down, but then she came back and said, let me check.

A word of warning for the Samsung LN40C630K1F,A-word-of-warning-for-the-Samsung-LN40C630K1F,"<p>The Mad Blogger is back! For this post TMB is a little torn. TMB isn't actually ranting, just giving people a word of warning, and some praise at the same time.</p>

<p>A month ago TMB moved, and because of that decided that it was time to get a new TV for the bedroom, rather than moving the old CRT across the country. So TMB picked up a Samsung 40' LCD TV that did 1080p and 120mhz, the model was LN40C630K1F and it was purchased from Best Buy. All seemed well at first, the TV performed great, until TMB noticed something, a blue pixel on the screen, when it shouldn't be blue. So after about a week (of the bad pixel) the TV went back to Best Buy to get exchanged for another of the same model.</p>

<p>I brought this new TV home and hooked it up, everything was great for a few minutes then the TV was attacked by some red vertical lines, which eventually turned to black.TMB checked connections, restarted everything, with no change. Eventually the lines went away, but they came back a few times throughout the week. </p>

<p>Today TMB took the TV back to Best Buy and picked up a 40' Sony LCD. Thanks to Best Buy for the great customer service! They were extremely helpful throughout the whole process. TMB went ahead and purchased their 4yr protection plan for the new TV, just in case anything goes wrong with this one.</p>",2010-05-15,html
