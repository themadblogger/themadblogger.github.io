<p>Damn skippy Viewpoint is Spyware.&nbsp;TMB doesn&#39;t care if <a href="http://ask-leo.com/is_viewpoint_spyware.html" target="_blank">they don&#39;t think it is</a>. It gets installed, without your knowing, then tries to update itself via the internet.</p><p>In the eyes of The Mad Blogger, VIEWPOINT IS SPYWARE.</p><p>Anyone who downloads and installs AOL Instant Messenger, AIM, will get Viewpoint. You don&#39;t have the option of not installing it. So, if you install AIM, be sure to go to control panel/add remove programs, and remove all instances of Viewpoint from your computer.</p><p>Plain and simple, Viewpoint is spyware. </p><p>TMB recommends using <a href="http://get.live.com/onecare/features" target="_blank">Windows Live Onecare</a> for all yoru Virus,spyware &nbsp;and firewall needs. It&#39;s only $50 to cover 3 computers with the software, TMB uses it and it works great!</p><p>The Mad Blogger ALSO suggests using <a href="http://get.live.com/messenger/features" target="_blank">Windows Live Messenger</a> for all your Instant Messaging needs.</p>
