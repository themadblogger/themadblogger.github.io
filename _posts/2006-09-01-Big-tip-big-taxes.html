<p>Now hear this, The Mad Blogger is not suggesting anyone try to skip paying taxes to the IRS, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/31/bigtip.ap/index.html" target="_blank">but this girl should never have made a mention about this huge tip, other than to her bosses to verify it was legit.</a></p>

<p>Now she&#39;s going to pay a big ole fat portion of that tip in taxes. Granted, because the tip was on a credit card she&#39;d probably have to report it on taxes anyways, but I&#39;d bet the tipper wasn&#39;t exactly looking for a lot of National press out of it. She also mentioned buying a Jeep with it, I hope it&#39;s a used jeep, because that tip once the taxes are taken won&#39;t buy any new car!</p>

<p>TMB worked in a restaurant for a few years in college, and always reported his tips, but I&#39;m sure many people in the industry make hundreds of dollars a night without reporting 5% of that money to the IRS.</p>
