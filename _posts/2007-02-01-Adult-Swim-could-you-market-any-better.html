<P>All this ranting about adult swim in the news industry, TMB actually thinks it was a great marketing idea. Even if turning broadcasting has to pay fines in Boston for the chaos that insued, they probably couldn't have spent better money on any other marketing campaign.</P>

<P>News coverage EVERYWHERE. Good call ATHF </P>
