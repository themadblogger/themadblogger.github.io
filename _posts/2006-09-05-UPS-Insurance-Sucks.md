Just because The Mad Blogger is still bitter about things that other companies have done in the past TMB needed to bring up some old posts to rant about. 

(old dead links removed, I really need to regenerate that content... )

TMB would highly suggest using another shipping company, anything but UPS. TMB goes out of his way to use Fedex or DHL whenever possible, just because of the crap that UPS and their insurance company, Liberty Mutual, tried to pull over on The Mad Blogger.

Well guess what guys, TMB is still mad!
