Goodcars.com, right. Glendale Chrysler should register the domain name www.BuyACarFromUsAndLoseYourIdentity.com

From what TMB hears Glendale Chrysler in Missouri hires sales guys that have criminal backgrounds, and then when a sale guy steals the identity of a customer they don't bother to do anything about it! The Mad Blogger knows a customer who had this happen to them!
