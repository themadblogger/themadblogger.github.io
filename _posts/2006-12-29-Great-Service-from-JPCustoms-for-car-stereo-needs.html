<P>TheMadBlogger loves his Zune. He loves it so much he wants to listen to it when he's driving in his pimped out Chevrolet Tahoe.</P>

<P>TMB purchased the Zune Car Pack from Circuit City a few days ago, it was horrible. The reception wasn't worth a darn, so TMB took the device back to Circuit City, they refunded the money without question. Props from the TMB to Circuit City.</P>

<P>Since that wouldn't work, TMB started looking for other options and found that <A href="http://www.jpcustoms.com/">www.JPCustoms.com</A> had just the attachment he needed to hardwire the Zune into the existing stereo of the Chevy Tahoe. That was two days ago, on Wednesday. The Mad Blogger received a package at work today from JP Customs with the product inside. Props to JPCustoms.com for the prompt service! </P>

<P>TMB will do a review after installing the device this weekend and seeing how well it all works.</P>
