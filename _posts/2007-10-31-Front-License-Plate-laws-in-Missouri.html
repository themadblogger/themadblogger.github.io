<P>TMB was hounded by a local police officer this morning here in Missouri. Why might you ask? Because TMB's new ride has only one license plate, in the rear. The officer was so excited he ran out of 7-11 and ran to check if the car had both plates. When he saw that it didn't he had TMB roll down the window and gave him a quick lecture on how he should have a front and rear plate, as that is the state law.</P>

<P>The Mad Blogger actually has much respect for Police officers, most of the time.</P>
