<P>Wow, this press conference they just held in California was such a crock. These two hoosiers from Georgia have turned on their spotlight for their 15 minutes of fame, I can't believe that this is getting any press. Right now they have nothing to prove a damn thing, all they have done is gotten so much traffic they've brought their website down.</P>

<P>BigfootTracker.com, right Cracksmokers.com is more like it.</P>
