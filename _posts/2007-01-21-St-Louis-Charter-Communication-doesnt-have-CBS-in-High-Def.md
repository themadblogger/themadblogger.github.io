Yet another reason that Charter Sucks. Here in St. Louis they no longer offer CBS in High Definition.

WTF Charter? TMB got a stupid letter a few weeks back saying that someone was going to start charging for CBS in High def, and Charter didn't think their customers should have to pay for it, so they aren't offering it anymore. Well guess what Charter, The Mad Blogger will gladly pay for CBS and ABC in high def, but you don't offer it. Guess what, Directv and Dish offer it, so I guess TMB will be going to one of them shortly. The fricken superbowl is on CBS this year, and Charter customers can't get it in HD, good move.
