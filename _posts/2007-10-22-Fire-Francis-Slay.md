The Mad Blogger thinks that all the folks in St. Louis City who are ranting and raving about Firing Francis Slay have way too much time on their hands. They should have plenty of time to maybe clean up their neighborhoods, or perhaps raise their children to be fine upstanding young citizens, rather than hoods like the kids who recently escaped from the juvenile facility in St. Louis.

On Fox2 news tonight there was some coverage on the protests downtown, they had a quick shot of a paper with a domain name on it. Funny thing is, the domain name doesn't even work!
