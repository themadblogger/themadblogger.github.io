<P>So The Mad Blogger is not a big Ford fan. Actually TMB has NEVER been a Ford fan, but TMB's wife owns a 2004 Ford F350, 6.0 liter Diesel. This truck is the biggest POS ever made. </P>

<P>It has been to the dealer, Bo Beuckman Ford probably 6-8 times in the past 24 months, the check engine light comes on constantly and they "repair it" yet it keeps happening, over and over and over again.</P>

<P>TMB is about ready to take this POS ford and go to a Chevy Dealership and buy a real truck. </P>

<P>Ford Sucks</P>

<P>Bo Beuckman Ford Sucks, don't go there. The service department is incompetent.</P>
