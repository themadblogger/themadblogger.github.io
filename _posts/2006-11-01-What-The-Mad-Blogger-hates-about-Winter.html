<p>The Mad Blogger is actually a Winter fan, so why would TMB write an article about what he hates about winter? Well there's one thing TMB can't stand about winter.</p>

<p>All that damn static! The Mad Blogger loves the cold, loves any snow/ice that comes his way, but can't stand getting shocked, or having shirts cling to him whenever he taked off his jacket!</p>

<p>Go away static, leave TMB with lots of Snow though this winter, TMB wants to test out his four-wheel-drive Tahoe!</p>
