For those of you who know The Mad Blogger you know that he has an Oakley problem. Well, there's a website called [SteepAndCheap](https://www.steepandcheap.com/) that doesn't help with the problem, they provide a lot of Oakley gear at great prices and lately TMB has ordered quite a few things. 

Today TMB received a winter jacket that was ordered last week but the fur was missing from around the hood. An email was sent earlier this afternoon via their Contact Us page, and what do you know, this evening TMB received a phone call from them saying that they would be sending a new jacket and providing a UPS label to ship the other one back.

Great Customer Service from [www.steepandcheap.com](https://www.steepandcheap.com/) you should check it out.
