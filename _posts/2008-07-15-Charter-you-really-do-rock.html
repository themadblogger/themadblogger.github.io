<P>So The Mad Blogger has had issues with Charter in the past, but the past two dealings have been GREAT!!!!</P>

<P><A  href="Charter-Youre-saving-TMB-Money">A few months ago they called to offer basic cable along with their 10mb service</A>, for a cheaper rate than TMB was paying for 10mb service alone, they scheduled an appointment to install the basic cable, but TMB cancelled the appt and never made another one.</P>

<P>Tonight TMB called Charter to see if the 16mb service was available, sure enough it was, and 4 minutes after placing the call the modem rebooted and The Mad Blogger was happily off the phone! </P>

<P>Charter, you rock!</P>
