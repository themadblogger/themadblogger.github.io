## Update: This one didn't age well. TMB is sorry for the loss of Cory Lidle

Did someone from the Yankees kill themselves over their recent loss to the Detroit Tigers in the playoffs?

According to the AP the plane that crashed into a building in NY today was owned by a Yankees pitcher. More info from TMB as it becomes available.

UPDATE: "New York Yankees manager Joe Torre says the plane that crashed into a building in Manhattan is registered to team pitcher Cory Lidle."
