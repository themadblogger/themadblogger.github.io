So TMB has been trying for 4+ months now to get some customer service from Injen Systems for the Super SES Exhaust on their Nissan 350z that has a massive leak in it.

Back in August TMB received a response from Injen

> Hi TMB,

> Can you send me a picture of your exhaust? I guess we had a few different ones made for that same vehicle and a photo would make it much easier to figure out what part and get you the correct part.


TMB responded with photos of the exhaust and what they needed. TMB has heard nothing back. They've emailed them multiple times, even emailing their tech and info email addresses, but so far TMB has not received a single response from them since that email quoted above.

TMB sure wishese they could get some help, previously TMB actually liked the exhaust on my 350z, but this has to be the worst customer service ever!


UPDATE: Good News! Injen came through! The car is all back to normal now and the leaky pipes were replaced!
