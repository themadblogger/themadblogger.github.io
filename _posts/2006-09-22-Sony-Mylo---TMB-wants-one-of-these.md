The Mad Blogger stumbled across something interesting today. <a href="http://www.learningcenter.sony.us/assets/itpd/mylo/prod/index.html" target="_blank">The Sony Mylo</a>. Perhaps TMB needs to go pick one of these up and give it a shot. That is, unless there's someone out there who wants to provide TMB with a free one! TMB will do a review for ya!


The Sony Mylo (My Life Online) is a handheld communication device that was first released by Sony in 2006. Designed primarily for young consumers who wanted to stay connected on the go, the Mylo featured several key functionalities:

Instant Messaging: It supported popular instant messaging services like Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, and Skype.

Web Browsing: The device had a built-in web browser, allowing users to access the internet via Wi-Fi.

Media Playback: Users could play music and video files on the device, with support for various media formats.

QWERTY Keyboard: The Mylo had a slide-out QWERTY keyboard for easy text input, making it ideal for messaging and emailing.

Wi-Fi Connectivity: It relied on Wi-Fi for internet access, as it did not have cellular capabilities.

There were two versions of the Sony Mylo: the original Mylo COM-1 released in 2006 and the Mylo COM-2 released in 2008. The Mylo COM-2 featured improvements such as a touchscreen interface, a better web browser, and enhanced multimedia capabilities. Despite its innovative features for its time, the Mylo series did not achieve widespread popularity and was eventually discontinued.
