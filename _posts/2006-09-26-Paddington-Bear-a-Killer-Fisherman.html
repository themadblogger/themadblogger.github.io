<p>&quot;MILFORD, N.H. - A teddy bear has been implicated in 2,500 deaths. Of trout, that is. State officials say a teddy bear dropped into a pool at a Fish and Game Department hatchery earlier this month clogged a drain. The clog blocked the flow of oxygen to the pool and suffocated the fish.</p>

<p>Hatcheries supervisor Robert Fawcett said the bear &mdash; a Paddington Bear dressed in yellow raincoat and hat &mdash; is believed to be the first stuffed bear to cause fatalities at the facility.&quot;</p>

<p>Look out fishies, Paddington Bear is out to get you!</p>
