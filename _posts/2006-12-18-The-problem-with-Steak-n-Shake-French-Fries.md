The Mad Blogger loves himself some Steak n Shake. A double steakburger with cheese please, an order of fries, and a vanilla shake (eggnog shake around the Holidays). That's some good stuff.

The only problem TMB has with Steak n Shake is their Fries. They are too small, so they don't hold heat for very long!

What do you think of SnS french fries? Are they worth the trouble?
