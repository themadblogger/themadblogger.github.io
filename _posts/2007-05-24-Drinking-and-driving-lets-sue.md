2022 Update: This blog post was not a highlight for TMB. Apologies if the Hancock family took offense. Sorry for your loss.

Shame on the Hancock family if they actually do go through with this rediculous law suit. Their son was drinking and driving, and killed himself. It's his fault, not anyone else's. The Mad Blogger is sorry for your loss but this isn't anyone's fault but Josh Hancock's.
