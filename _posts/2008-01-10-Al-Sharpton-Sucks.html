Sorry Al, but TMB thinks you are simply a press hog always looking to jump into the spotlight over the most trivial things. Such as Kelly Tilghman's stupid comment about "lynching" Tiger Woods. She didn't mean it in a racist way, get over yourself. This country is far too sensative to simple words. <A  href="http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/7655864?MSNHPHCP&amp;GT1=10838">Checkout this article to see why The Mad Blogger thinks Al Sharpton sucks</A>.
