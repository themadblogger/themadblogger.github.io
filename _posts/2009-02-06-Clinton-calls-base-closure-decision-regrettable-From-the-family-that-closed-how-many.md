The Mad Blogger finds this headline on CNN about the closing of the US Military base in Kyrgyzstan extremely annoying.

<A href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/clinton.kyrgyzstan/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/clinton.kyrgyzstan/index.html</A>

Wasn't it her f'n husband who closed down a LARGE number of US Military bases in our own country?

TMB is not a Clinton fan.
