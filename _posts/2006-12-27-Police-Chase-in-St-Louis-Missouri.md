Originally recorded in February of 2005, I had this uploaded and online within an hour of the event and saw tremendous downloads/plays for it, before uploading it to YouTube later.

This police chase was live on the air, notice the camera man realizes what he just put on live TV, whoops. Yes, the guy dies, but no, it didn't actually role over on him.

A Police Chase in St. Louis Missouri driving east on Highway 40/64, the crash happens over Lindbergh Boulevard, this overpass has since been rebuilt with the reconstruction of Highway 40.
