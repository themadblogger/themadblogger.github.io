If you are in the Bay Area and are looking for a ride to the Airport, be sure to NOT use Pacific Airport Shuttles.

This morning (around 7:45am pacific time) on the way to work (11/17/2011) TMB was cut off by two of Pacific Airport Shuttles vans, number 921 and 978. They were headed up 92 from Half Moon Bay, and after having been caught up in traffic where the highway merges from 2 lanes to 1, they decided to cut around cars after the "do not pass" signs and move up. 

Very rude thing to do as drivers, and it wasn't just one of them, but both vans did this.

The Mad Blogger won't be using Pacific Airport Shuttles anytime soon.
