<p>So I've been trying for 4+ months now to get some customer service from Injen Systems for the Super SES Exhaust on my Nissan 350z that has a massive leak in it.</p>

<p>Back in August I received a response from Injen</p><blockquote ><p>Hi Chris,</p>

<p>Can you send me a picture of your exhaust? I guess we had a few different ones made for that same vehicle and a photo would make it much easier to figure out what part and get you the correct part.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I responded with photos of the exhaust and what I needed. I have heard nothing back. I've emailed them multiple times, even emailing their tech and info email addresses, but so far I have not received a single response from them since that email quoted above.</p>

<p>I sure wish I could get some help, I actually liked the exhaust on my 350z, but this has to be the worst customer service ever!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>UPDATE: Good News! Injen came through! The car is all back to normal now and the leaky pipes were replaced!  <a href="https://www.project350z.com/injen-super-ses-installation-on-the-350z">https://www.project350z.com/injen-super-ses-installation-on-the-350z</a></p>
