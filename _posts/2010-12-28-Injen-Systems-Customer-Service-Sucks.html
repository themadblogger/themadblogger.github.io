<p>Back in August I received a response from Injen</p><blockquote style="font-family:'Lucida Console', monospace;"><p>Hi Chris,</p>

<p>Can you send me a picture of your exhaust? I guess we had a few different ones made for that same vehicle and a photo would make it much easier to figure out what part and get you the correct part.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight:800;"><br></span></p></blockquote><p>I responded with photos of the exhaust and what I needed. I have heard nothing back. I've emailed them multiple times, even emailing their tech and info email addresses, but so far I have not received a single response from them since that email quoted above.</p>

<p>I sure wish I could get some help, I actually liked the exhaust on my 350z, but this has to be the worst customer service ever!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Good News! Injen came through! The car is all back to normal now and the leaky pipes were replaced! &nbsp;<a href="http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/489/Injen-Super-SES-Installation-on-the-350z.aspx">http://www.project350z.com/Articles/itemId/489/Injen-Super-SES-Installation-on-the-350z.aspx</a></p></div></div>
