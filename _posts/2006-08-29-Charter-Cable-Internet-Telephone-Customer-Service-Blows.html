<p>If you're looking to get Digital Cable, Internet or Phone Service from Charter Communications, The Mad Blogger would HIGHLY recommend looking to another provider!</p>

<p>TMB has had horrible experiences with Charter over the past few months. Just so you know TMB isn't the only one complaining check out this recent article in the <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/business/columnists.nsf/techtalk/story/79D69F12C866F53286257194004A5C3E?OpenDocument">St. Louis Post Dispatch</a>!</p>

<p>Moral of the story? Charter Sucks! Use someone else! Though, TMB also doesn't recommend Directv, more on that story later!</p>
