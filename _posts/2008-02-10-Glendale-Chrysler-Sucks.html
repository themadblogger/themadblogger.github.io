<P>Goodcars.com, right. Glendale Chrysler should register the domain name <A href="http://www.buyacarfromusandloseyouridentity.com/">www.BuyACarFromUsAndLoseYourIdentity.com</A> </P>

<P>From what TMB hears Glendale Chrysler in Missouri hires sales guys that have criminal backgrounds, and then when a sale guy steals the identity of a customer they don't bother to do anything about it! The Mad Blogger knows a customer who had this happen to them! </P>
