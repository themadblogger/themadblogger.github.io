<p>So, I had my trusty (no, it&#39;s not really trusty) Moxi record Studio 60 tonight on NBC. I must admit, after the first 5 minutes I was ready to delete the show and clean it off my series list. </p><p>Though, after making it through the first 5 minutes it started to pick up. It&#39;ll stay on my series list at least one more week, and I predict probably even longer than that.</p>
