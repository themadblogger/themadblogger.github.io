<p>The Mad Blogger wonders what this world is really coming too. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/22/news/companies/toy_recall/index.htm?cnn=yes" target="_blank">A company recalls all of a product line</a> because two families were dumb enough to let their kids play with toys they weren&#39;t old enough for? </p>

<p>&quot;The two 3-inch plastic nails in Playskool&#39;s &quot;Team Talkin&#39; Tool Bench&quot; led to the death of two young children, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.&quot; <br />&quot;Playskool, a unit of Hasbro Inc., said it received reports that a 19-month-old boy from Martinsburg, W.Va., and a 2-year-old boy from League City, Texas, suffocated when oversized, plastic toy nails sold with the tool bench toys became lodged in their throats. &quot;</p>

<p>TMB thinks it&#39;s a parent&#39;s responsibility to protect their kids. Companies shouldn&#39;t held liable for stupid people&#39;s mistakes.</p>
