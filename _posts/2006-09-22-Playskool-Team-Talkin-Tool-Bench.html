<p>The Mad Blogger wonders what this world is really coming too. <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/09/22/news/companies/toy_recall/index.htm?cnn=yes" target="_blank">A company recalls all of a product line</a> because two families were dumb enough to let their kids play with toys they weren't old enough for? </p>

<p>"The two 3-inch plastic nails in Playskool's "Team Talkin' Tool Bench" led to the death of two young children, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission." <br />"Playskool, a unit of Hasbro Inc., said it received reports that a 19-month-old boy from Martinsburg, W.Va., and a 2-year-old boy from League City, Texas, suffocated when oversized, plastic toy nails sold with the tool bench toys became lodged in their throats. "</p>

<p>TMB thinks it's a parent's responsibility to protect their kids. Companies shouldn't held liable for stupid people's mistakes.</p>
