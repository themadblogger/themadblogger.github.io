<p>If you're shopping for a car, TMB highly recommends you stay away from Glenn Hyundai in Lexington Kentucky. There are a few stories going around on the internet in which a sales guy at Glenn Hyundai put the car on Ebay, and now won't sell the car at the final selling price of the auction. Even threatening the buyer with a lawsuit if he doesn't stop posting on the internet. You can find more on the story from <a href="http://jalopnik.com/5453145/kentucky-hyundai-dealer-wont-honor-ebay-auction-deal-calls-buyer-psycho" target="_blank">Jalopnik</a> and <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/2010/01/20/hyundai-dealer-auctions-genesis-coupe-for-16k-doesnt-want-to/" target="_blank">Autoblogs</a>. </P>

<P>Sounds like something <a href="/Dont-go-to-Glendale-Chrysler-in-St-louis-MO" target="_blank">Glendale Chrysler</a> would try to pull, don't shop there either! They have previously employed people who steal identities from car buyers. </p>
