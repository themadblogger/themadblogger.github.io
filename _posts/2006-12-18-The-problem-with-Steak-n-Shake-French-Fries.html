<p>The Mad Blogger loves himself some Steak n Shake. A double steakburger with cheese please, an order of fries, and a vanilla shake (eggnog shake around the Holidays). That&#39;s some good stuff.</p>

<p>The only problem TMB has with Steak n Shake is their Fries. They are too small, so they don&#39;t hold heat for very long!</p>
