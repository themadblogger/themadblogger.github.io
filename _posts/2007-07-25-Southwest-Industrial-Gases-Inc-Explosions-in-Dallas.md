Just like a few years ago it here in St. Louis with Praxair, it looks like there has been another accident with a gas/fuel supplier. From news reports it looks like Southwest Industrial Gases Inc in Dallas Texas is having troubles today with exploding tanks! Look out in Dallas! TMB hopes everyone keeps safe down there.
