The Mad Blogger sure is glad he isn't a beta tester for Magnetic Trains in Germany! 

"He said the train had collided with an object on the track while travelling at a speed of at least 200 km/h (120 mph) and that several passengers had been seriously injured."

Sounds like a big old deer stepped out in front of the wrong train!
