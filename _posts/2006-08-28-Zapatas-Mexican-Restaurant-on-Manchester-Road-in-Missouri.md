If you're looking for some good Mexican food, DON'T go to Zapatas on Manchester Road!

The Mad Blogger went w/ the office the day they opened, for lunch, to give them a shot. The food was horrible, no one enjoyed their meals. TMB figured, maybe, just maybe, that was just a bad day to go, the first day a place is open.

So, a month later, TMB tried it again. TMB and Family went there for dinner. It was STILL HORRIBLE. The food is just very low quality, high prices and the chips both times tasted burnt.

So, if you are looking for a restaurant on Manchester road for some good Mexican, TMB suggests trying one of the other places on Manchester Road. Senor Pique's (sp?) down near Sulpher Springs Road is a good start, TMB's eaten there on many occasions and it's been great food and service.

Don't eat at Zapata's, trust The Mad Blogger!
