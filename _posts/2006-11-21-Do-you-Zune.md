Do you Zune? The Mad Blogger does! And TMB is loving it! 30 gigs of wonderful music and videos. The Zune will be the entertainment choice for The Mad Blogger's upcoming wedding flights.

TMB has loaded up on a lot of shows not seen yet this year and hopes to get caught up with some of the new series on TV this fall. Now, the key will be picking up the new powerpack coming out on 11/30 so that TMB has enough juice in his Zune for a flight from LA to Miami to Costa Rica on the 3rd!

If you're looking for some of the latest dirt on the Zune check out the Zune Insider's blog (link removed).
