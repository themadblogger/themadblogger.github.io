Be careful who you hire to do your painting in St. Louis. Karl Rich painting got a nice layer of overspray on The Mad Blogger's car.

Supposedly they have sent a check to TMB to make up for this, we will see, right now TMB is just ticked because it's been 3 hours and only the top and front of the car is clay barred, not the sides or rear...
