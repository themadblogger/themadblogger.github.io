The Mad Blogger is a happy guy again. Tropical Smoothie Cafe opened back up in Des Peres.

So far this week TMB has had a wrap and two smoothies from TSC. Unfortunately TMBs tastes for the Tropical Smoothie Cafe wraps has gone away, not because the store opened back up, they were starting to wear thin before it closed down. TMB loves the wraps from Crazy Bowls and Wraps, TSC's wraps just don't compare.

Tropical Smoothie sure does have the best smoothies though!

Thanks for opening back up!
