<P>The Mad Blogger really doesn't think this is a bad deal for business, InBev made a high offer, the boards both agreed, and now AB is part of InBev.</P>

<P>The "bad" part of this will be the potential impact it has on the various communities that Anheuser-Busch is a part of. Right now AB pushes out a lot of goodwill/donations to organizations all over the US, and probably the world. Will InBev do the same? That remains to be seen.</P>
