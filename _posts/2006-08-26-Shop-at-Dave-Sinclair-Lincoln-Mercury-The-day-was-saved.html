<p>So The Mad Blogger (TMB) went out shopping for a car this evening, trying to repair <a href="http://themadblogger.org/blogs/themadblogger/archive/2006/08/25/Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge_2C00_-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks.aspx">the chaos that was earlier today</a>.</p><p>Long story short (it&#39;s too late right now, long story to come tomorrow), TMB is VERY happy this morning(night). TMB has a new ride. An 05 Chevy Tahoe Z71 with less than 8k miles on it! TMB will ALSO be getting some 20&#39;s tomorrow morning for the Tahoe. Photos and the rest of the story to come tomorrow!</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chammond/224920125/">Flickr photo</a></p>
