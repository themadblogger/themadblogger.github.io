<p>So The Mad Blogger (TMB) went out shopping for a car this evening, trying to repair <a href="/Why-not-to-buy-from-Southtown-Dodge-AKA-Southtown-Dodge-Sucks">the chaos that was earlier today</a>.</p>

<p>Long story short (it's too late right now, long story to come tomorrow), TMB is VERY happy this morning(night). TMB has a new ride. An 05 Chevy Tahoe Z71 with less than 8k miles on it! TMB will ALSO be getting some 20's tomorrow morning for the Tahoe. Photos and the rest of the story to come tomorrow!</p>
