TMB hasn't made a post in quite a while but here's a post to make up for the delays...

What's the deal with Sears.com. The Mad Blogger was looking around for something he purchased this evening at Sears.com, with the intentions of linking to it, but with Sears.com you can't copy and paste the URL of your browser into an email, IM window, or even a blog post, the darn URLs have session cookies in them. 

Sears.com, what were you thinking?

Here's an example

http://www.sears.com/sr/javasr/product.do?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&amp;pid=00959746000&amp;cat=Storage,+Chests+%26+Cabinets&amp;subcat=Garage+Organization&amp;vertical=TOOL&amp;ihtoken=1

Edit: Here's the best part. TMB sent himself a "send to a friend" email via Sears.com, and guess what. The link included in that email didn't work either! Sears.com, please fix your site for your customers!
