<p>If you&#39;re looking for some good Mexican food, DON&#39;T go to Zapatas on Manchester Road!</p>

<p>The Mad Blogger&nbsp;went&nbsp;w/ the office the day they opened, for lunch, to give them a shot. The food was horrible, no one enjoyed their meals. TMB figured, maybe, just maybe, that was just a bad day to go, the first day a place is open.</p>

<p>So, a month later,&nbsp;TMB tried it again. TMB and Family went there for dinner. It was STILL HORRIBLE. The food is just very low quality, high prices and&nbsp;the chips both times tasted burnt.</p>

<p>So, if you are looking for a restaurant on Manchester road for some good Mexican, TMB suggests trying one of the other places on Manchester Road. Senor Pique&#39;s (sp?) down near Sulpher Springs Road is a good start,&nbsp;TMB&#39;s eaten there on many occasions and it&#39;s been great food and service.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t eat at Zapata&#39;s, trust The Mad Blogger!</p>
