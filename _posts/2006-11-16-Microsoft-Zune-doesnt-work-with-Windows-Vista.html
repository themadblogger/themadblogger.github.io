<p>Hello, Microsoft? What were you thinking? You have a brand new Operating System, Windows Vista, which TMB loves btw, and a brand new Music Player, Zune, which TMB also loves, and the two don&#39;t work together!</p>

<p>Hello??? Is there anyone out there? Left hand, meet the right hand. Vista and the Zune don&#39;t work together. WTFO?</p>
