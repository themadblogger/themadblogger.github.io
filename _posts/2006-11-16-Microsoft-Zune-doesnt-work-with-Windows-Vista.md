Hello, Microsoft? What were you thinking? You have a brand new Operating System, Windows Vista, which TMB loves btw, and a brand new Music Player, Zune, which TMB also loves, and the two don't work together!

Hello??? Is there anyone out there? Left hand, meet the right hand. Vista and the Zune don't work together. WTFO?
